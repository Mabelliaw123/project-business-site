# Business Site



It is  **signup form** that we are building for this week. I am starting to get to know a little of Javascript better. 

A simple sign up form that confused more on how to code than the content itself. It contains:

- 3 x Text fields
- 1 x A email field
- 1 x Set of placeholder
- 1 x Submit button


## The problem

I could have done better, in having more varies like buttons, options, and more styling when time allows.
